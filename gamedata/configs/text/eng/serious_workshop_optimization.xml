        <text>As the stash of the workshop grows in size the opening of the workshop becomes slower and slower.  
This mod combats that by not trying to load in the whole stash all at once, but rather do it Asynchronously.  
The system will load in `N` (depends on MCM config) amount of items from the stash to your inventory then it will let other scripts run for a set amount of time (depends on MCM config)  
and after this delay it will again load `N` items. Rince and repeat until the whole inventory is loaded.</text>
